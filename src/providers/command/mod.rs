//! The command runner: a pane provider whose capabilities are commands the
//! user's config gives (ADR 0006, #86 decision D2, #93 decisions 10, 13–15,
//! 19, 21 and 22). `docs/capabilities.md` is its contract.
//!
//! - Each ask runs its capability's argv once, without a shell, its
//!   placeholders replaced (`inputs.rs`), in the choosing attach's
//!   environment, stripped of `<NAME>` and the per-act variables, plus the
//!   act's own; in the attach's working directory, else `/`. stdin is
//!   `/dev/null`, and it runs in its own process group (`run.rs`).
//! - Nothing waits: its pipes, its exit and its deadlines are watched on a
//!   loop of its own, which the daemon watches under `Token::Provider`
//!   (`fd`).
//! - Exit 0 is done, and an open's first stdout line, trimmed, the terminal
//!   id: at most 4 KiB, no NUL; `report_layout`'s stdout, at most 1 MiB,
//!   the live layout (`layout.rs`). Exit 69, or a command that can't start,
//!   is unsupported; anything else fails. The first 64 KiB of stderr goes
//!   to the log.
//! - `report_layout` runs beside `focus` and `focus_direction`, in another
//!   queue: a report started before one of them ended may have read focus
//!   before it landed, so its `focus` is dropped. The daemon takes a
//!   reported focus after the act for the user's own move
//!   (`provider_focus.rs`), and reads the layout again after the act.
//! - At its timeout its group gets SIGTERM, and SIGKILL 1 s later. The act
//!   itself is timed out by `asks.rs`, at the same deadline: a run past it
//!   answers nothing, but says the layout may have changed once it ends.
//! - `events` runs from the start, for as long as the runner lives (#86
//!   decision D7, #93 decision 18, ADR 0006 as #126 amends it). Each line
//!   it prints is told as `ProviderEvent::LayoutChanged`, for the daemon to
//!   ask `report_layout` through its layout queue; a JSON object line's
//!   `closed` is told as `Closed` before it. A line's `focus`, a terminal
//!   the daemon is to follow:
//!   - Without `report_layout`, it is told as `Focused` before it.
//!   - With `report_layout`, it waits: it may have been read before a
//!     focus act landed and come after its answer, and `provider_focus.rs`
//!     takes no report to be older than the focus answered (SPI-1159). A
//!     report started after the last line, and after the last focus act
//!     ended, tells the focus it read in its place, or, if it read none,
//!     failed or ran past its time, the line's own. One started before a
//!     focus act ended tells nothing, whatever became of it, and says the
//!     layout changed, for another to be asked. A report's exit 69 ends
//!     the waiting, as without `report_layout`.
//!     A report started after the last line, and after the last focus act
//!     ended, also tells the focus it read if it isn't the one last told
//!     since a focus act ended: a line names a focus only when it changed
//!     from its own last line.
//!
//!   Lines over 64 KiB are dropped. Once it ends, or a restart can't start,
//!   it starts again after 1 s, then 2 s, doubling up to 60 s; one that ran
//!   60 s waits 1 s again. Exit 69, or a first start that fails, ends it for
//!   good.
//!
//! - `find` prints the terminal's id like an open (ADR 0006, #93 decision
//!   17); what each answer means is the daemon's. A pair's halves run as
//!   one runner: its terminal half's `open` and `close`, its layout half's
//!   layout capabilities, and no one-step capability (`Spec::of`).
//!
//! Choosing a spec through the config is #129's.
