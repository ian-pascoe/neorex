# The config

Your own Lua file chooses each daemon's pane provider: what gives Neovim's
windows terminals of their own (ADR 0007). With no file, the built-in default
chooses: tmux, herdr or zellij in a pane of its own, Rex inside Rex, else
none (see
[The default](#the-default) and
[Built-in pane providers](#built-in-pane-providers)). `docs/capabilities.md`
is the contract of a pane provider's commands.

## The file

The daemon reads `$NEOPANE_CONFIG` if it is set and not empty, made absolute
against the directory `neopane` started in (`~` isn't expanded), else
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neopane/init.lua` (an absolute `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` only),
else `~/.config/neopane/init.lua`, on macOS too. It reads
`$NEOPANE_CONFIG` once, as it starts: a later attach's never counts. With
no file at the default places, the built-in default chooses; a file
`$NEOPANE_CONFIG` names that isn't there is an error (see [Errors](#errors)).

The file runs afresh each time a terminal chooses the pane provider: when
a terminal attaches by itself (as `neopane` or `neopane attach` does) and the
daemon has none. Each run is a child process of the daemon's own binary,
in the choosing attach's working directory (`/` if it has gone), with the
environment its commands get (`docs/capabilities.md`, "Running a command").
It has 3 s to answer; once it has answered, or its time is up, its process
group is killed, so nothing it started outlives the choice. A fix to the
file applies at the next choice, and a file made after the daemon started is
read then too, wherever it is. `--provider none` (or
`NEOPANE_PROVIDER=none`) chooses none without running it.

It returns a table whose only key is `provider`, a function called with the
choosing attach:

```lua
return {
  provider = function(attach)
    if attach.env.TERM_PROGRAM == "ghostty" then
      return { terminal = ghostty, layout = aerospace }
    end
    return neopane.default(attach)
  end,
}
```

The Lua is 5.1, PUC Lua as Neovim users write it, with `string`, `table`,
`math`, `io`, `os`, `coroutine` and `package`, and no sandbox: `io`, `os`
and `dofile` stay. `require` looks only in the file's own `lua/` directory
(`lua/?.lua`, `lua/?/init.lua`), and loads no C modules. `print`,
`io.write`, `io.stdout` and `io.stderr` go to the daemon's log, line by line,
as `config: <line>`, up to 64 KiB a run; stdin is empty. Prefer
`neopane.run` to `os.execute` and `io.popen`: it gives up in time for the
config to answer.

While the file runs, the terminal that chose shows its first window at once;
new windows, and the terminals that attach meanwhile, wait for the choice.

## `attach`

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `env` | The choosing attach's environment, as it attached: names to values, raw bytes |
| `cwd` | Its working directory, absolute |
| `tty` | Its tty, such as `/dev/ttys014`; `""` when it has none |
| `pid` | The attaching helper's pid |
| `daemon` | The daemon's name |
| `provider` | The hint: `--provider P`, else `$NEOPANE_PROVIDER`; nil without one |

They are plain tables: changing them changes nothing outside this run.
The hint means what your code makes of it; only `none` means something to
neopane, and the file doesn't run for it.

## What `provider` returns

- `nil` or `false`: no pane provider. Windows are drawn in the terminal
  they were opened from, as plain Neovim draws splits.
- `"rex"`: Rex's pane provider, built in. It works only in a Rex pane.
  The other built-ins are tables, such as `neopane.builtin.tmux()`.
- A pane provider table, used whole.
- A pair, `{ terminal = T, layout = L }`, or one side alone, `{ terminal = T }`
  or `{ layout = L }`: `T` is a terminal provider, which opens and closes
  terminals, and `L` a layout provider, which finds, places and focuses
  them. A pair takes only `T`'s `open` and `close` and its attach timeout,
  and only `L`'s other capabilities, `context_vars` and `find_vars`, so it
  always opens, then places. Rex is never half of a pair. An optional
  `name` names the pair, `"<T's name>+<L's name>"` by default.

The chosen pane provider's `find` (its own, or its layout side's) then
confirms the choice for the choosing attach: exit 0 or 69, or no `find`,
accepts it; anything else means no pane provider, with a warning, so a
`TMUX` leaked into a Ghostty window doesn't send new windows to a tmux pane
nobody sees. The file's 3 s are its own: `find` then has 3 s to confirm the
choice, or its own timeout (`timeouts.find`) if that is longer.

With no config, `find` refusing the built-in default's choice goes only to
the daemon's log, with no warning: the default guessed from variables that
may have leaked into a terminal from whatever started it. So does the
default's choice failing to start, as Rex does when stale `REX_SERVER` or
`REX_SESSION` name a server that's gone or a session it doesn't have.

`list` and `status` show the result as the pane provider's name (a pair's
as `T+L`), `(choosing)` while the file runs or `find` hasn't answered, or
`none`, `none (can't start)`, `none (config error)`, `none (find refused)`
or `none (hint none)`. `none (can't start)` means the pane provider chosen
couldn't be started or reached, or went before `find` answered.

## Pane provider tables

Each capability is an argv, a list of strings run once without a shell, its
whole-word placeholders such as `{attach}` replaced; `false` counts as
absent. `docs/capabilities.md` says what each is given, what it prints and
what its exit status means.

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `name` | Shown in the log, warnings, `list` and `status`; never matched |
| `open` | Opens a terminal running `{attach}`, and prints its id |
| `close` | Closes `{terminal}` |
| `find` | Prints the attaching terminal's id; exit 69: unsupported |
| `place_beside` | Moves `{terminal}` beside `{origin}` |
| `resize` | Resizes `{terminal}` along its split with `{origin}` |
| `focus` | Focuses `{terminal}` |
| `focus_direction` | Moves focus `{count}` steps `{direction}` |
| `report_layout` | Prints the layout as JSON |
| `events` | Prints a line whenever the layout changes; runs until it ends |
| `open_beside`, `open_float`, `open_tab_page` | One-step opens, from a table returned whole only |
| `timeouts` | Seconds per capability, over 0 and at most 60 |
| `attach_timeout` | Seconds from an open's exit to its terminal attaching; default 5 |
| `protocols` | The `NEOPANE_PROTOCOL` numbers it speaks; default `{ 1 }` |
| `context_vars` | Variables a terminal must share with the choosing one to be in reach |
| `find_vars` | The attaching terminal's variables `find` gets, as `$NEOPANE_ENV_<VAR>` |

No capability is required: a table with only `open` opens a terminal for
each new window and places none.

## The `neopane` global

Also `require("neopane")`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `neopane.default(attach)` | What the daemon chooses with no file (see [The default](#the-default)): tmux's, herdr's or zellij's table, as `neopane.builtin.tmux()`, `neopane.builtin.herdr()` or `neopane.builtin.zellij()` returns it, `"rex"`, or nil. Ignores the hint, never raises |
| `neopane.run(argv, opts)` | Runs a command without a shell and waits for it, at most `opts.timeout` seconds (1 by default, cut to the config's time left less 0.25 s). Returns `{ ok, code, stdout, stderr, error }`; raises only on bad arguments. `opts` also takes `cwd`, `env` (a string sets a variable, `false` removes it) and `stdin` |
| `neopane.which(program)` | The absolute path of the first executable `program` on `PATH`, or nil; with a `/`, that path if it is executable. Runs nothing |
| `neopane.builtin` | Functions that each return a fresh built-in table, to return as it is or copy and change: `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`. They take no options, and raise on any |
| `neopane.inside` | Functions `(attach) -> ok, why` that prove the attach's terminal is directly a multiplexer's own pane: `tmux` and `herdr`, asking the multiplexer within 0.5 s, and `zellij`, from the process table alone. They read `attach.env`, `attach.tty` and `attach.pid`, and never raise |
| `neopane.os` | `"macos"` or `"linux"` |
| `neopane.version` | The daemon's version |
| `neopane.config_dir` | The absolute directory of the file that ran |

## The default

`neopane.default(attach)`, which chooses with no file, names built-ins from
the environment only:

- tmux: `TERM_PROGRAM` is `tmux` and `TMUX` is set and not empty.
- herdr: `TERM_PROGRAM` is `herdr` and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` is set and not
  empty.
- zellij: `ZELLIJ` is set, and `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID` is set and not empty.
- Rex: `REX_SERVER` and `REX_SESSION` are both set, even if empty.

Naming one, it chooses that one and runs nothing. A multiplexer's panes
inherit the variables of whatever started its server, though: a tmux started
in a Rex pane gives its panes Rex's variables, and a terminal started from a
tmux shell has tmux's. Naming several, it asks each multiplexer's `inside`
in turn, tmux's, herdr's then zellij's, and takes the first that proves;
else Rex if named, else none. Rex is never proven there: its `find` proves
it. The daemon runs the proofs off its loop, and new windows wait for them
as they do for a config.

`neopane.inside.tmux(attach)` runs tmux's `find`'s whole check: tmux must be
3.2 or newer, and the attach's tty a pane of the tmux server `TMUX` names.
So it is true exactly when `find` would accept the attach; `TMUX_PANE` isn't
needed. Its `why`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `true, "tmux pane %4"` | the pane |
| `"TMUX isn't set"` | |
| `"the attach has no tty"` | |
| `"can't run tmux: <error>"` | tmux isn't on the attach's `PATH`, say |
| `"tmux: <first stderr line>"` | tmux failed, as when no server listens at the socket |
| `"tmux didn't answer in 0.5 s"` | |
| `"tmux 3.1c is too old: the built-in tmux needs 3.2 or newer"` | |
| `"the attach's tty \"/some/file\" isn't one"` | `tty` is set but isn't a terminal's |
| `"this terminal (/dev/ttys003) isn't a pane of the tmux server at <socket>"` | |

`neopane.inside.herdr(attach)` runs herdr's proof, which its `find` runs
too: `ping`, refusing a herdr whose protocol is below 22 (herdr 0.9.5's);
then the pane the attach's `HERDR_PANE_ID` names, whose process's
controlling terminal must be the attach's tty, compared by device. herdr's
own `tty` field is always empty, and `HERDR_PANE_ID` alone proves nothing:
a tmux in a herdr pane passes it on to its own panes. Where it can't be
proved, as when the pane has no process, `inside.herdr` says no, and `find`
trusts `HERDR_PANE_ID`, the pane being there. Its `why`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `true, "herdr pane w1:p4"` | the pane |
| `"HERDR_ENV isn't 1"` | |
| `"HERDR_PANE_ID isn't set"` | |
| `"HERDR_SOCKET_PATH isn't set"` | |
| `"the attach has no tty"` | |
| `"can't reach herdr at <path>: <error>"` | no server listens at the socket, say |
| `"herdr didn't answer in 0.5 s"` | |
| `"herdr: <error.message>"` | herdr refused, as for a pane it doesn't have |
| `"herdr's answer can't be read"` | |
| `"herdr 0.9.4 speaks protocol 21; the built-in herdr needs 22 or newer"` | |
| `"herdr pane w1:p4 has no process"` | unprovable |
| `"can't read the terminal of herdr pane w1:p4's process (pid 32523)"` | unprovable |
| `"the attach's tty \"/some/file\" isn't one"` | `tty` is set but isn't a terminal's |
| `"this terminal (/dev/ttys003) isn't herdr pane w1:p4's (/dev/ttys009)"` | |

`neopane.inside.zellij(attach)` runs no zellij command: zellij tells no
pane's tty or process. It reads the process table instead. Whatever zellij
starts in a pane, a shell or a command, leads its own session on the pane's
tty, a child of the zellij server. So it is true when `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID` and
`ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME` are set, the attach has a tty, the attach's process
(`attach.pid`) has a session leader on that tty, and the leader's parent is a
process whose name holds `zellij`. A process table it can't read proves
nothing, and the variables are trusted. Its `why`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `true, "zellij pane terminal_3"` | the pane, `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID`'s |
| `true, "zellij pane terminal_3 (unproven: can't read the process table)"` | |
| `"ZELLIJ_PANE_ID isn't set"` | |
| `"ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME isn't set"` | |
| `"the attach has no tty"` | |
| `"the attach's process (pid 4242) has gone"` | |
| `"this terminal (/dev/ttys003) isn't a zellij pane's: its session leader (zsh, pid 4100) is on /dev/ttys009"` | a process on another terminal, with a pane's variables, such as a tmux pane's started from a zellij pane |
| `"this terminal (/dev/ttys003) isn't a zellij pane's: its session leader's parent is tmux (pid 812)"` | |

Its `find` adds two checks, asking zellij: zellij must be 0.46.0 or newer,
and the session must list the pane, not exited. A multiplexer's `find`
still confirms the choice, and refusing it goes only to the log: the
default guessed. `provider check` shows what it named and each proof's
answer.

## Errors

Any error means no pane provider for that choice, never the default.

A file `$NEOPANE_CONFIG` names that isn't there is an error. Only an empty
default place, with `$NEOPANE_CONFIG` unset, means the built-in default
chooses.

A file that fails to load or raises, runs out its 3 s, ends without
answering, or returns something malformed is an error too: a wrong type,
an argv with a hole (is a variable nil?), a side with no usable
capability, a paired `"rex"`, or no protocol number shared with neopane.
Anything unknown, such as a key, a field or a placeholder, gets a warning
and is ignored, a capability holding an unknown placeholder with it; a
time over 60 s gets a warning and is cut to 60 s. So an older daemon still
reads a newer file.

Each choice shows its problems as one warning in Neovim, the first error
or else the first warning, with the count of the rest:

```text
neopane: config: provider().layout.focus[2]: expected string, got number (wrap numbers in tostring()) (and 2 more: neopane provider check)
```

The daemon's log has every one, and `list` shows `none (config error)`.
The next terminal that attaches by itself runs the file again.

A file `$NEOPANE_CONFIG` names that isn't there warns with its path:

```text
neopane: config: /home/me/my.lua isn't there (NEOPANE_CONFIG names it); no pane provider
```

A `find` that refuses the choosing attach warns too, quoting its first
stderr line:

```text
neopane: aerospace: find didn't confirm this terminal (exit 1); no pane provider
neopane: tmux: find didn't confirm this terminal (exit 1: tmux find: this terminal (/dev/ttys029) isn't a pane of the tmux server at /private/tmp/tmux-501/default); no pane provider
```

With no file, `find` refusing the built-in default's choice warns of
nothing: it goes to the log, and `list` shows `none (find refused)`. Its
choice failing to start, such as Rex unreachable, warns of nothing either,
and `list` shows `none (can't start)`.

## `provider check`

```text
neopane provider check [--config FILE] [--provider P] [--daemon-name N] [--no-find] [--full] [--json]
```

Runs your config as a terminal attaching here would, and reports what it
chose. It finds the file as the daemon would, and runs it in the same child
process, with the same checks and the same 3 s, for an attach made from this
shell: its environment and working directory, stdin's tty (`""` if stdin
isn't a terminal), its own pid, the daemon name and the hint. Then it runs
the chosen pane provider's `find` as a self-attach here would: it writes the
pane title `neopane-<token>` into this terminal, runs `find` with the pane
id `0-<token>`, and puts the old title back (clearing it in a terminal that
keeps no title stack). Rex's `find` needs no title. It runs no other
capability. With stdin not a terminal, it writes no title and runs no
`find`, and the result is `ok (find not run)`.

- `--config FILE`: the file; by default `$NEOPANE_CONFIG`, then the default
  places, as [The file](#the-file) says. A file that `--config` or the
  variable names and that isn't there is an error; its message says which
  named it.
- `--provider P`: the hint; by default `$NEOPANE_PROVIDER`. `none` skips the
  file; `""` means no hint.
- `--daemon-name N`: `attach.daemon`; by default the name a daemon started
  in this directory gets, with no `-2` suffix.
- `--no-find`: `find` isn't run.
- `--full`: shows everything. Without it, a capability's line is cut at 100
  columns with `…`, and at most 20 of the lines the config printed are
  shown, then `(N more: --full)`.
- `--json`: one JSON object, below.

The report's sections:

| Section | Shows |
|---|---|
| `config` | the file; `no file: neopane.default chooses`; or `skipped: hint none` |
| `attach` | its tty (or `no terminal`), pid, working directory, daemon name and hint |
| `ran` | how long the file took and the lines it printed; or its Lua error, with Lua's traceback where it gives one, the timeout, or why it ended without answering |
| `chose` | none, `"rex"`, a table, a pair or one side alone, its name and Lua path, and whether `provider()` or `neopane.default` chose |
| `default` | when `neopane.default` chose with no file: the built-ins the environment names (`default  names tmux and rex`), and each `inside` it asked, as `  inside.tmux  no: <why>` |
| `whole`, `terminal`, `layout` | each table in use, by its role: its name, Lua path and agreed protocol; each capability it gives, present (its argv on one line, and its timeout), ignored (and why) or absent (and what does without it, such as `open_float  absent: float groups are drawn in panes`). A pair's terminal side lists the one-step capabilities too, absent from a pair, and either side lists any it gave that are ignored. `live layout` (`yes: report_layout and events`, `yes: report_layout (read after each act)` or `no: each pane is its own layout area`), `reach` (its context variables, with this attach's values) and `find vars` show for a table that gives the layout, so not for a terminal side; `attach timeout`, such as `5 s (default)`, for one that opens terminals, so not for a layout side |
| `one-step` | the one-step capabilities, or `none: a pair opens, then places` |
| `tmux` | for a table whose capabilities run `{exe} provider builtin tmux`, such as `neopane.builtin.tmux()` or a changed copy of it: the `tmux` on `PATH` (or `not on PATH`), its version, the socket `TMUX` names, whether the server answers (or why not), and each capability in use that this tmux is too old for, such as `open_float  exits 69: needs tmux 3.7, this is 3.4` and `events  exits 69: needs tmux 3.8, this is 3.4`; below 3.2, `missing  every capability (needs tmux 3.2, this is 3.1c)` |
| `zellij` | for a table whose capabilities run `{exe} provider builtin zellij`, such as `neopane.builtin.zellij()` or a changed copy of it: the `zellij` on `PATH` (or `not on PATH`), its version, the session `ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME` names (or `none: ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME isn't set`), the socket directory `ZELLIJ_SOCKET_DIR` names (or `none: ZELLIJ_SOCKET_DIR isn't set`, where zellij looks in its own), and whether the session answers `list-panes`, as `find` asks it (or why not); below 0.46.0, `missing  every capability (needs zellij 0.46.0, this is 0.45.1)`. Every capability's zellij calls need that session, found through the same variables and `HOME` |
| `rex` | for `"rex"`: the server's URL, version and API revision (`server.version`'s, else the one its welcome agreed), and, for a server older than this build speaks, `missing  every capability (needs Rex API revision N, this server has M)`: Rex doesn't say which revision each method came in, so it isn't told capability by capability |
| `find` | the title written and put back, `find`'s exit status, time and id, and whether the choice is accepted or refused; for Rex, `proven: block:… is this terminal's`, `disproved: REX_BLOCK names another terminal (/dev/ttys009)` (the path where the system names it: on macOS, and for a pseudo-terminal on Linux), or `unprovable: <why>; trusted REX_BLOCK`; or `not run: <why>` |
| `errors`, `warnings` | every problem, with its path |
| `result` | `ok`, `none` or `error`, quoting the exact message Neovim would show; or `none (find refused): <message>` when `find` refused the default's choice with no file, which the daemon only logs |

For example, in Ghostty, for the config in
[Ghostty with AeroSpace](#ghostty-with-aerospace):

```text
config  /Users/me/.config/neopane/init.lua
attach  tty /dev/ttys014, pid 4242, cwd /Users/me/src/work, daemon work, no hint
ran  3.1 ms, 0 lines printed
chose  a pair, ghostty+aerospace, at provider(), by provider()
terminal  ghostty at provider().terminal, protocol 1
  open  sh -c 'exec open -na Ghostty.app --args --title="$NEOPANE_TITLE" --abnormal-command-exit-ru…
  close  absent: a terminal it opened closes only as its attach ends
  open_beside  absent: open, then place_beside
  open_float  absent: float groups are drawn in panes
  open_tab_page  absent: tab pages stay whole in the pane they opened in
  attach timeout  5 s (default)
layout  aerospace at provider().layout, protocol 1
  find  /Users/me/.config/neopane/bin/aerospace-find  (3 s)
  place_beside  absent: a terminal it opened stays where it opened
  resize  absent: a terminal keeps the size it opened at
  focus  aerospace focus --window-id {terminal}  (2 s)
  focus_direction  aerospace focus --boundaries-action stop {direction}  (2 s)
  report_layout  absent: each pane is its own layout area
  events  absent: no live layout
  live layout  no: each pane is its own layout area
  reach  every terminal (no context variables)
  find vars  none
one-step  none: a pair opens, then places
find  accepted: id 31337 (exit 0, 412.0 ms, title neopane-k3j9x2qpa8 written, then restored)
result  ok
```

It exits 0 for a pane provider, or for none by design (`provider()` returned
`nil` or `false`, the hint is `none`, or with no file, a `find` refusing the
default's choice), also when `find` wasn't run; 1 for an error, or a `find`
refusing a config's choice; 2 for a usage error. Warnings don't change it.

  below the floor. Its `needs` is a tmux version, a string, where `rex`'s
  is an API revision, a number.
- `zellij`: null unless a table in use runs `{exe} provider builtin zellij`;
  else `{"path", "version", "session", "socket_dir", "answers", "error",
  "missing"}`: each of the first four is null when unknown or unset,
  `error` says why the session didn't answer, and `missing[]` is empty, or
  holds one `{"capability": null, "needs": "0.46.0"}` below the floor, a
  zellij version, a string.
- `default`: null unless `neopane.default` chose with no file; else
  `{"named": ["tmux", "rex"], "inside": [{"name": "tmux", "ok": false,
  "why": "…"}]}`: the built-ins the environment names, in order, and each
  `inside` asked.
- `problems[]`: `level` is `error` or `warning`; `path` is the Lua path, the
  file's name for its own table, or null.
- `result.state`: `ok`, `none` or `error`; `message` is what Neovim would
  show, or null. `refused`, there only when `find` refused the default's
  choice with no file (`state` `none`), is the warning a config's choice
  would have shown.

As with `list --json`, fields are only ever added, never removed, renamed,
or changed in type or meaning; a missing one means unknown.

## Built-in pane providers

`neopane provider show` lists the built-ins: `rex`, which has no Lua table
(return `"rex"` from `provider()` to use it), `tmux`, `herdr` and `zellij`.
`neopane provider show NAME` prints a built-in that has a Lua table as a Lua
file, to copy into your `init.lua` and change. Its every capability runs
`{exe} provider builtin NAME CAPABILITY`: neopane itself, speaking the
capability contract for that multiplexer (`docs/capabilities.md`, "Built-in
commands").

`:vertical resize` and `:resize` on a window resize its pane too, in any tab
page, whichever side of a split the window is on. Each pane has its own
message row and the panes a border between them, where Neovim's screen has
one command line, so with `:resize` a lower window's pane can come up to two
rows short. Rex resizes only a split it placed, or one whose two panes sit
side by side in its layout: in the first tab page, where panes stay where
they opened, resizing a window of three or more may leave its pane as it was.

### tmux

On by default: run `neopane` in a tmux pane (tmux 3.2 or newer), with no
config, and each Neovim window gets a tmux pane of its own, split beside the
pane it came from; on tmux 3.7 or newer, a group of floats you enter gets a
tmux floating pane. `<C-w>h/j/k/l` move tmux's focus, stopping at the
window's edge, and each tab page gets a tmux window. On tmux 3.8 or newer,
moving between panes with tmux's own keys, or clicking one, moves Neovim's current
window there at once; older tmux has no way to tell neopane unasked, so the
move is learned at the next key you type or the next focus report. `neopane
provider check` shows what your tmux can do. The default knows tmux by its
own variables, `TERM_PROGRAM=tmux` and `TMUX`, and where Rex's are set too,
asks `neopane.inside.tmux` (see [The default](#the-default)); its `find`
then checks the terminal is a pane of that tmux server, by its tty, so a
`TMUX` leaked into another terminal chooses nothing, and says so only in the
log. A config gets the same table from `neopane.builtin.tmux()`, and may
change any capability of it:

```lua
return {
  provider = function(attach)
    local tmux = neopane.builtin.tmux()
    tmux.timeouts = { open_beside = 10 } -- a slow machine
    return tmux
  end,
}
```

To opt out, run `neopane --provider none` or set `NEOPANE_PROVIDER=none`,
or have your config return something else in tmux, such as `nil`.

### herdr

On by default: run `neopane` in a herdr pane (herdr 0.9.5 or newer, socket
protocol 22), with no config, and each Neovim window gets a herdr pane of its
own, beside the pane it came from, in its herdr tab. The default knows herdr
by its own variables, `TERM_PROGRAM=herdr` and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`; its
`find` then proves the terminal is the pane `HERDR_PANE_ID` names, by the
tty of that pane's process, so herdr's variables copied into another
terminal choose nothing, and say so only in the log. Its reach is the herdr
server `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` names, every workspace of it: a herdr workspace is
no boundary. A config gets the same table from `neopane.builtin.herdr()`,
and may change any capability of it.

herdr's split can't run a command, so a new pane is made in a tab of its
own, running the attach with no shell, then moved beside its origin, and
the tab laid out again (ADR 0017). Its limits:

- The temporary tab flashes in herdr's tab bar for one frame, labelled with
  the pane's title, `neopane-` and a token.
- If herdr doesn't answer the request that makes the tab in time, the open
  fails and closes the tab with that label. A tab herdr makes only after
  that shows until its attach is refused, its pane given up, and closes
  with it.
- A pane can't open beside one in a zoomed tab: the open fails, leaving no
  tab behind, as when herdr can't.
- Each pane's frame is reported as herdr's default borders draw it: a cell
  all round in a tab with a split, none for a lone pane. Other border
  settings (`ui.pane_borders`, `pane_gaps`, `pane_outer_borders`) put the
  insets off by a cell or two, which no part of herdr's API tells.
- A pane you move to another workspace gets a new id there, which neopane
  doesn't follow: its Neovim pane becomes a layout area of its own.
- Focus is one per herdr server, not per client: when Neovim's current
  window moves, every herdr client attached follows, as with herdr's own
  keys.
- A tab page gets a herdr tab of its own, in the workspace of the pane it
  opened from.
- herdr moves no pane within its tab, so a pane neopane moves there goes
  out to a tab of its own and back (ADR 0018), which may show in the tab
  bar for a frame. If herdr refuses the way back, the pane stays in that
  tab until the tab page's windows next change, when neopane places them
  again (SPI-1194). Nothing moves in a zoomed tab, nor to another
  workspace.
- Sizes are set through herdr's split ids, which herdr doesn't document:
  neopane reads them strictly (ADR 0018), and if a herdr means something
  else by them, resizing fails, changing nothing, and says so in the log.
- Each of herdr's panes has its own frame, where Neovim has one separator
  between two windows: in a row of two, the right one's pane gets the
  columns Neovim gives its window, and the left one's three fewer, after
  `:vertical resize` on either (SPI-1193). herdr keeps each side of a
  split at 10 % of it or more.
- A zoomed tab shows the zoomed pane alone, the one focused, as herdr's
  zoom follows focus; the panes it hides are a layout area of their own.
- For now no floats: a float group is drawn in its pane.

### zellij

On by default: run `neopane` in a zellij pane (zellij 0.46.0 or newer), with
no config, and each Neovim window gets a zellij pane of its own, split beside
the pane it came from, named `neopane`; a group of floats you enter gets a
zellij floating pane, pinned, and each tab page a zellij tab. `<C-w>h/j/k/l`
move zellij's focus, stopping at the tab's edge, and going to a tab page
focuses its tab. zellij moves the focus of the client that last pressed a
key: until you have typed in it, Neovim moves no zellij client's focus. The
default knows zellij by its own variables, `ZELLIJ` and `ZELLIJ_PANE_ID`, and
where tmux's, herdr's or Rex's are set too, asks `neopane.inside.zellij`
after tmux's and herdr's (see [The default](#the-default)); its `find`
checks the same, then that the session lists the pane. Every zellij call is
`zellij --session "$ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME" action …`, in the environment of
the terminal that chose zellij: zellij finds a session by its socket
directory (`ZELLIJ_SOCKET_DIR`) and its cache, under `HOME`. A terminal of
another zellij session, or with another `ZELLIJ_SOCKET_DIR`, is out of
reach: a window opened from it is drawn in its pane. `neopane provider check`
shows your zellij, its version and the session it reaches. A config gets the
same table from `neopane.builtin.zellij()`.

Its limits, for now:

- zellij splits only to the right or below, halving the pane split: a
  window opened on the left or above, as `:vsplit` and `:split` open it, is
  split to the right or below, then swapped with the pane it came from.
  zellij resizes only in steps of 5 %, so the table has no `place_beside`
  or `resize`: a pane keeps the size zellij gives it, so three windows side
  by side take a half and two quarters.
- A split fails while the tab shows its floating panes: they are hidden
  around each split and shown again, so they may flicker. If they can't be
  hidden, the open fails, as any failed open does, with no split.
- A tab page's zellij tab is made from your tab template: with a
  `new_tab_template` of several panes, its window opens in the bare one,
  and the others run what the template says, as foreign panes.
- zellij shows a tab's floating panes only while one has focus: Neovim's
  are pinned, so they show over the tab whichever pane has focus, as a
  Neovim float does, and hiding the tab's floats leaves them shown.
- With several clients attached, zellij doesn't say which you type in, so
  a focus move made with zellij's own keys isn't followed by Neovim, and
  with one, it is followed only at the next report, such as when the pane
  you went to reports focus: zellij can't tell neopane unasked.

## Editor setup

`neopane provider types` writes the config's types for lua-language-server
(LuaLS) into the config's directory: the directory of `--config FILE`, else
of `$NEOPANE_CONFIG`, else `~/.config/neopane` (created if missing).

- `types/neopane.lua`, a `---@meta` file with the global `neopane` and the
  classes `neopane.Config`, `neopane.Attach`, `neopane.Provider`,
  `neopane.Timeouts`, `neopane.Pair`, `neopane.Choice`, `neopane.RunOptions` and
  `neopane.RunResult`. It is rewritten each time: run the command again after
  upgrading neopane. Its second line names the build that wrote it.
- `.luarc.json`, only if there is none: LuaLS's `$schema` and
  `"runtime.version": "Lua 5.1"`. It never sets `workspace.library`, since
  the types file is inside the workspace. Edit it as you like; later runs keep
  it.

```console
$ neopane provider types
wrote ~/.config/neopane/types/neopane.lua
wrote ~/.config/neopane/.luarc.json
no init.lua yet: see https://github.com/ian-pascoe/neopane/blob/main/docs/config.md
```

Open `~/.config/neopane` as the editor's workspace folder. LuaLS reads neither
file in single-file mode, so opening `init.lua` on its own gets no types.

Annotate the table you return to have it checked:

```lua
---@type neopane.Config
return {
  provider = function(attach)
    return neopane.default(attach)
  end,
}
```

[lazydev.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazydev.nvim) adds Neovim's own
`vim` API to every Lua workspace, which the config doesn't have. Turn it off
where a `.luarc.json` is:

```lua
{
  "folke/lazydev.nvim",
  ft = "lua",
  opts = {
    enabled = function(root)
      return not vim.uv.fs_stat(root .. "/.luarc.json")
    end,
  },
}
```

## Ghostty with AeroSpace

An example, untested: Ghostty opens a window per Neovim window, and
AeroSpace finds, focuses and moves between them. Ghostty's `--title=` (one
word: `--title VALUE` doesn't parse, and `-e` must come last) fixes the
window's title for good, so Ghostty ignores the escape sequences that would
change it, and AeroSpace finds the window by that title. The macOS form,
`open -na Ghostty.app --args --title=… -e …`, is checked against Ghostty's
source but not run; on Linux it is `ghostty +new-window --title=… -e …`.
Tab pages are drawn in the window they opened from; a Ghostty table returned
whole, with `open_tab_page` set to `open`'s argv, gives each its own window.

```lua
-- ~/.config/neopane/init.lua
---@type neopane.Provider
local ghostty = {
  name = "ghostty",
  -- --title= fixes this window's title for good (Ghostty then ignores OSC 0/2); AeroSpace finds it by that title.
  -- macOS (source-verified, not run). Linux: 'exec ghostty +new-window --title="$NEOPANE_TITLE" -e "$@"'
  open = { "sh", "-c",
    'exec open -na Ghostty.app --args --title="$NEOPANE_TITLE" --abnormal-command-exit-runtime=0 -e "$@"',
    "sh", "{attach}" },
}
---@type neopane.Provider
local aerospace = {
  name = "aerospace",
  find = { neopane.config_dir .. "/bin/aerospace-find" },
  focus = { "aerospace", "focus", "--window-id", "{terminal}" },
  focus_direction = { "aerospace", "focus", "--boundaries-action", "stop", "{direction}" }, -- once, whatever the count
}
---@type neopane.Config
return {
  provider = function(attach)
    -- Ghostty first: REX_* leak into a Ghostty window started from a Rex shell; TERM_PROGRAM names the innermost terminal.
    if attach.env.TERM_PROGRAM == "ghostty" and neopane.which("aerospace") then
      return { terminal = ghostty, layout = aerospace }
    end
    return neopane.default(attach)
  end,
}
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# ~/.config/neopane/bin/aerospace-find: the AeroSpace window whose title holds $NEOPANE_TITLE.
# AeroSpace may not list a new window at once, so try for about 2.5 s (find has 3 s).
i=0
while [ "$i" -lt 10 ]; do
  ids=$(aerospace list-windows --all --format '%{window-id}|%{window-title}' |
        grep -F -- "$NEOPANE_TITLE" | cut -d'|' -f1)
  case $(printf '%s' "$ids" | grep -c .) in
    1) printf '%s\n' "$ids"; exit 0 ;;
    0) sleep 0.25; i=$((i + 1)) ;;
    *) exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
exit 1
```
